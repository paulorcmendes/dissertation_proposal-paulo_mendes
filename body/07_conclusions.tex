\section{Contributions}
\label{sec_4}
 As collateral contributions of this research, three papers have been published in relevant multimedia conferences \cite{mendes2020cluster, mendes2020authoring, mendes2020ISM}. In \cite{mendes2020authoring}, we have developed an authoring model and a player for interactive 360ยบ video. In \cite{mendes2020cluster}, we have evaluated video face clustering together with a cluster-matching method for video face recognition. In \cite{mendes2020ISM}, we have used video face clustering and the presence of actors in different video as a mean for recommending educational videos. We have also created a synthetic dataset for face detection in equirectangular images.

\section{Expected Contributions}
\label{sec_5}
In our dissertation, we aim at exploring the usage of spatiotemporal localization of actors and its applications in video. We intend to investigate its usage in the tasks of video face recognition and recommendation. Moreover, we will examine the applicability of this method in the authoring process of interactive 360-video with dynamic subtitles based on actors localization.
