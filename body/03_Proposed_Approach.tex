\section{Approach}
\label{sec:approach}
Let us define as \emph{actor} each person present in a 360º video. Therefore, the goal of our approach is to place subtitles based on the actors' position on a given 360° video. To accomplish this goal, we use face detection and clustering mechanisms to identify the actors' trajectory 360° video. Then, based on this trajectory, we place dynamic subtitles following the actors' path. For didatic purposes, we decided to divide our exposition in three phases: (i)~\emph{face detection in 360° videos}, (ii)~\emph{actors clusterization}, and (iii)~\emph{dynamic subtitles positioning}. These phases are described in the following subsections. 

\subsection{Face Detection in 360° videos}

In this phase, we aim at detecting the actors' faces present in the 360° video frames.

\subsection{Actors Clusterization}

In this phase we aim at clusterizing the face embeddings and 

\subsection{Dynamic Subtitles Positioning}
